Step 1: Go to CMS DAS and find the AOD or MINIAOD corresponding to the run era.
Step 2: Take a txt format list ("plain") of the run,lumi pairs in the run. E.g. "run,lumi dataset=/JetHT/Run2017C-31Mar2018-v1/MINIAOD".
 das_client --query="run,lumi dataset=/JetHT/Run2016B-07Aug17_ver1-v1/MINIAOD" > B1/lumis.txt
Step 3: Copy this list into the corresponding folder with the name "lumis.txt". E.g. "B/lumis.txt".
Step 4: Run init.sh. This produces the corresponding .json files and also goes through luminosities for the given files.
Step 5: Run triggerlister.sh for each folder. This produces a file that lists all the relevant available trigger versions. E.g. "bash triggerlister.sh". Remember to adjust the correct folders here!
Step 6: The preparations are done for creating pileup histograms. The preferred method is to use puhistos_versions.sh.
 - One needs to adjust the pileup file, normtag and datacert here
 - One needs to check that the min bias xsec has not changed (default) for brilcalc
 - One needs to configure the list of correct folders and trigger versions here. The required trigger versions are found from the triggerlists.txt file!
 - Suggesting to run one folder at a time
Step 7: Go to each folder separately and run "root -l -b -q ../puhistos_combineversions.C". This will create a collection of pileup_DTu.root.
 - The unnormalized histograms may be safely added with hadd.
 - This requires the correct weight values to be present in settings.h.
Step 8: Run "root -l -b -q ../puhistos_normalize.C". This will results in appropriately weighted histos.
